	<span id=f002">Am I the asshole for telling my pregnant sister I don't want to help raise her kids?</span><br/>
	<span id=f003">I'm 30 Female</span><br/>
	<span id=f004">My mom is 65 Female</span><br/>
	<span id=f005">My sister is 38 Female</span><br/>
	<span id=f006">My sister's son is 10 months old</span><br/>
	<span id=f007">She's basically a single mother</span><br/>
	<span id=f008">She works a full-time job and is the breadwinner, and is also the parent who takes care of the baby the most</span><br/>
	<span id=f009">The father only works part-time as a waiter to focus on his “art” (making music)</span><br/>
	<span id=f010">He says he can't look after the kid because he's tired after his part-time job</span><br/>
	<span id=f011">They are struggling with money and have downgraded to a smaller apartment to save on rent</span><br/>
	<span id=f012">My mom has been giving them money every month and buying them baby stuff</span><br/>
	<span id=f013">Me and my mom (mostly my mom) have been helping her take care of the child</span><br/>
	<span id=f014">She spends a week out of the month over their apartment to help take care of the baby</span><br/>
	<span id=f015">My mom comes home and I go over there for the next week</span><br/>
	<span id=f016">We have been alternating like that</span><br/>
	<span id=f017">It's taken a toll on my mom's mental and physical health</span><br/>
	<span id=f018">I also don't like it because I feel like I should be focusing on my own life My sister is pregnant again</span><br/>
	<span id=f019">Me and my mom are horrified that she is keeping it</span><br/>
	<span id=f020">She also announced that she is breaking up with her boyfriend and that he isn't going to coparent</span><br/>
	<span id=f021">My mom is nearing retirement and told me she doesn't want my sister and her kids to depend on her</span><br/>
	<span id=f022">My mom said she mentally, physically and financially can't help my sister with raising 2 babies</span><br/>
	<span id=f023">I also did not sign up for this responsibility</span><br/>
	<span id=f024">So we set some boundaries with her and told her we won't be helping as much and if she keeps the baby she needs to figure out the child care by herself</span><br/>
	<span id=f025">My sister got upset and complained to her auntie (my mom's sister)</span><br/>
	<span id=f026">Now that side of the family is calling us selfish</span><br/>
	<span id=f027">Are we the asshole?</span>
