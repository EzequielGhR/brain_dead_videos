	<span id=f001">Post on "Am I the asshole" by "throwawayaccount4990", at "02 of January 2024, at 10:20"</span><br/>
	<span id=f002">Am I the asshole for “ruining Christmas” and being upset the only gifts I got from my family were “joke gifts”</span><br/>
	<span id=f003">Some background, my family likes to play pranks with Christmas and birthday gifts it's nothing new</span><br/>
	<span id=f004">I ( Fe Male ale 21) as well as my 5 siblings (from 29 to 37 years old) have all been pranked on our birthdays and on Christmas and usually it's one or two gifts</span><br/>
	<span id=f005">This Christmas though, I was the only person to get all joke gifts</span><br/>
	<span id=f006">For example, I unwrapped a MacBook from my brother, but when I opened it, it was just some chocolate (which I don't eat so I gave it away) and the MacBook was actually given to my sister inside a bag she wanted</span><br/>
	<span id=f007">Another “gift” was what I thought was a book I put on my Christmas list was actually just the book cover put on a dictionary</span><br/>
	<span id=f008">When I asked my mom about the book she told me she gave it to my Sil This went on with each present my siblings or parents had given me</span><br/>
	<span id=f009">AirPods was just a charger block? Adapter? gift cards were used and had $0 balance, a card with Monopoly money, and so on totaling to about 12 joke gifts</span><br/>
	<span id=f010">I realized I went out of my way to get everyone something they wanted or they'd like didn't get anything</span><br/>
	<span id=f011">At this point i was bummed so I went to the living room to watch tv with my boyfriend</span><br/>
	<span id=f012">At dinner they were all talking about how much they loved their gifts and when my dad asked why I hadn't said anything about mine, I said there wasn't much to say</span><br/>
	<span id=f013">Everyone but my boyfriend laughed and my mom said it was no big deal as everyone else also got some joke gifts</span><br/>
	<span id=f014">I told her every gift I got was a joke gifts and that the ones they got was also followed by the real one</span><br/>
	<span id=f015">My dad told me I needed to relax as I'm making a big deal about it and I'd have next Christmas to get the stuff on my list</span><br/>
	<span id=f016">Not wanting to go back and forth i told my boyfriend I wanted to leave and we can spend the rest of Christmas break with his family then go home</span><br/>
	<span id=f017">My family got mad and told me not to go and to just stay because it wasn't serious</span><br/>
	<span id=f018">I left and put my phone on do not disturb during the drive and by the time we got to bf's parent's house, I had several missed calls and texts from them calling me names like ungrateful, sensitive, and childish</span><br/>
	<span id=f019">They said I ruined Christmas and made my parents upset cause I left</span><br/>
	<span id=f020">The next day, I exchanged and opened gifts with my boyfriend and his family and one of the gifts I had gotten was the book I wanted (the book my mom pretended to gift me)</span><br/>
	<span id=f021">I posted it on my instagram story and not even 0 minutes after posting it, my sister sent a screenshot of my story to the family group chat and they basically got mad at me for leaving and telling me I ruined Christmas over some presents</span><br/>
	<span id=f022">They told me I owe everyone, especially my parents, an apology because my mom spent new years sad because of my actions</span><br/>
	<span id=f023">Now I just want an outside party to tell me if I'm TA here? Am I in the wrong for being upset about the gifts and for leaving? After reading their messages and sitting on this for a few days I'm now feeling like maybe I was upset over nothing and need to apologize to them</span><br/>
	<span id=f024">*Gonna edit as there may have been some misunderstanding, my Christmas list didn't include expensive gifts nor was I upset I didn't receive expensive gifts</span><br/>
	<span id=f025">I was merely upset because of being pranked with everything I got and being the only person who didn't get a real present that is all</span><br/>
	<span id=f026">Another thing I'll address is I dint do anything to my family which would warrant them doing this</span><br/>
	<span id=f027">The last “big argument” I had was with my sister which was over a year and a half ago</span><br/>
	<span id=f028">Thank you for the replies and I will try my best to reply to comments while I'm at work</span><br/>
	<span id=f029">Editing once more to add I participated in joke gifts when I was a kid, haven't participated in the last 10+ years because I didn't enjoy it or find if funny (which thy do know)</span><br/>
	<span id=f030">I will reply with more info if needed when I'm on break or have time to reply</span><br/>
	<span id=f031">- and I am familiar with the term scapegoat but truthfully don't fully understand so I will research that as well</span>
